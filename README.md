# Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Language Translation

### Objectives
Create an automatic machine translation model for at least one pair of languages

### Type of Model
Seq2Seq RNN

### Dataset
http://www.manythings.org/anki/

### Getting started link
https://github.com/OValery16/Language-Translation-with-deep-learning-


## Code structure
As of now all the code exists in the `bailey_test.py` file.
We have had trouble getting the models to train and for simplicity reasons I have wrote all my code in one file.

## Example Code
The given code is a simple CNN example training on the MNIST dataset. It shows how to set up the [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)  package to monitor how your network is learning, or not.

Before running the code you have to create a local environment with conda and activate it. The provided [environment.yml](https://github.com/DCC-UAB/XNAP-Project/environment.yml) file has all the required dependencies. Run the following command: ``conda env create --file environment.yml `` to create a conda environment with all the required dependencies and then activate it:
```
conda activate xnap-example
```

To run the example code:
```
python main.py
```
