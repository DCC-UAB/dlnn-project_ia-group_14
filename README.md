# Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Language Translation

### Objectives
Create an automatic machine translation model for at least one pair of languages

### Type of Model
Seq2Seq RNN

### Dataset
http://www.manythings.org/anki/

### Getting started link
https://github.com/OValery16/Language-Translation-with-deep-learning-


## Code structure
We finally manged to distribute the necessary code in the "utils/utils.py" and "language_translation" files. 

These contain the architechture that, after a complete restructuration and change in the point of view of the code, serve us to structure all the necessary functions for running the translator. We left some previous attempts just to keep the progress, as well as other code that help us achieving the goal.

We also applied the recommendations of the teacher in the previous presentation, applying SpaCy functions to get more optimal results.
